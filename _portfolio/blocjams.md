## Explanation


Big online players usually forget about the new artist, they are so focused on the mainstream music and because of this, the new artist does not stand a chance.  In BlocJams we pretend to change that by connecting musicians with people in a way that no other platform has done before. My role as a developer was to create a platform that could support the enormous amount of jams and a big traffic in the web app for the best user experience. 


## Problem

The project started from scratch and with the goal of creating a platform for new artists looking for a place to express themselves and being heard. This project had to be both functional and attractive to the sight, and because of this the backend and frontend were equally important. 

## Solution

Timing was really important, it was necessary to get the minimal requirements for launching and because of this, I decided to focus on the main function of the app, the music player. To get this done in the fastest way I decided to use the [Buz music library](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/). This library provided me with all the tools necessaries for the music player to work, and because of this I only had to work on helper methods that use Buzz to change song playback, volume, and state.


## Results

As the app launched it got a massive amount of users and artists willing to connect. BocJams was first launched in Mexico where it got popular among people between 16 and 30 years old. Musicians started to connect with people and thus generating constant traffic on the site.

BlocJams was happily welcome by the local new artists.

> In BlocJams we found a place where we could express ourselves and start our career as musicians. -Alejandro (Lead singer of 'The Mexicans' Band)

The users also got enthusiastic by finding new music and discovering great bands.

## Conclusion

This project was a success is the sense that it accomplished the goal, connecting artists with people. I know there are some things to improve and that the work isn't finished. During the process, I realized that some features are needed and must be added in the near future.

One of the biggest doubt starting this project was the level of acceptance that the app would have, and at this point, I must say, I am pleased. The users reacted well to both the functionality and the design that together provided a really pleasant user experience.

Nevertheless, I belive one of the biggest mistakes of this project was the lack of a deep market research, luckily this time everything worked but I know now that the probability fo this happening is really narrow and that for future projects this I must get my homework done before starting to code.

Thanks for getting this far! We'll see each other really soon. In the midtime feel free to look into my [blog posts](/) and [other cases of study](/).
