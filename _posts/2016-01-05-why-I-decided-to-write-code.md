title: Why I decided to write code?
---
Ever since I was a little kid I always wanted to be an architect, an architect? yes, an architect. 

I decided this to be my fist post because is a good way to introduce myself and also maybe this may help someone confused about what they want to do with their lives.

So, as I was saying, when I was younger my dream was to be an architect, but, what changed? to be honest nothing changed. I liked architecture because creating new things is my passion, I also enjoyed the idea of making something that would last and that everyone could see and recognize, but as I grew up I noticed that in architecture if you want to build something you must know  two things; f your project get chosen it's going to take a lot of time and a lot of money.

After realizing that I was confused, I was in my last year of high school and had no idea what I wanted to do with my life I had three options in my mind, Industrial Design, Mechatronic and Informational Technologies. For around one month I talked with a lot of people, students, graduates, classmates and program directors and finally the IT director told me something no one told me before, I'm sure if someone had I will be studying something different, he said 'study IT this semester, we have almost the same subjects with the other two, if you don't like it just change to something else' and so I did.

So there I was, in my first Univerity class, Introduction to programming. First I have to say that I was the only one in the class that had absolutely no experience at all in computers, all my classmates had some experience programming or at least some special interests that are usually associated with IT like video games, hardware, networks, and all I had was a brand new crappy computer with one main purpose: Facebook. But despite all of this I was enthusiastic, I started learning the basics conditional statements, loops, variables and I said to myself 'So this is how a computer works... nice'. In no time I was almost at the same level as my classmates and that was cool. I remember my first project, it was a really simple game made with some Pokemon sprites and a free visual programming language called [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). And at that moment, even though my game was crap and the code was made with colored blocks, I fell in love with programming. I was so excited about creating something entirely new in only two weeks! I was proud and started showing it to everyone, this game was my baby and only mine.

While making that game I realized something, that became the answer to the question, why do you like coding?.I like it because when you do it you see an almost immediate result, is not like a building that you have to wait years and must invest a lot for it to be done, with a computer and almost $0 Pesos (yes Pesos, I'm Mexican btw.) you may have something cool and functional in a couple of weeks. Also is really satisfying to get a problem and dived it in a bunch of small easy problems and as you solve them get that rewarding feeling of accomplishment.

And that's the reason why I decided to code. Thanks for getting this far I sincerely hope this post helps someone to choose what they want to do with their lives and if you have any questions just send me an [email](/contact) or something, I would be happy to help!
